In this guide, I'll show you how to pull a Laravel project from Git, set it up locally, and run the application.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Git
PHP
Composer
Laravel CLI
A web server (such as Apache)
A database management system (such as MySQL)

## Step 1: Clone the Git repository

First, clone the Laravel project repository from Git to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

    - git clone https://github.com/madhuraj2211/SwipeWireMultipleTodo.git 

## Step 2: Install dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    - composer install

## Step 3: Create a .env file

The `.env` file contains configuration settings for the Laravel application, such as database credentials, mail settings, and more. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

    - cp .env.example .env
    (or)
    - copy .env.example .env

Then, generate a new application key by running the following command:

    - php artisan key:generate

This command will generate a new random key and add it to the .env file.

## Step 4: Set up the database

Next, create a new database for the Laravel application on your local machine. Then, update the `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` fields in the .env file to match your database credentials.

   - DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   - DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   - DB_PORT=3306
   - DB_DATABASE=Multiple_Todo
   - DB_USERNAME=root
   - DB_PASSWORD=

Run the following command to run database migrations and seed the database with initial data:

    - php artisan migrate --seed

## Step 5: Serve the application

To serve the Laravel application locally, run the following command in the project's root directory:

    - php artisan serve

This command will start a local development server at `http://localhost:8000`.
